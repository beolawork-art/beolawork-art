## 🚀 My Data Science Journey and Focus

Hello, I'm Olaitan. I am currently transitioning into Data Science, strategically building a foundation that emphasizes hands-on application and real-world problem-solving.

### 📚 Core Focus & Education

- **Structured Learning:** Completed the intensive Data Science program at **Utiva**.
- **Technical Strengths:** Focused on mastering the core pillars of the data science workflow: **Python** (Pandas/NumPy), **SQL** for data retrieval, **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, and fundamental **Machine Learning** techniques (e.g., Regression and Classification models).
- **Version Control:** Dedicated to establishing robust version control and collaboration skills using **Git/GitHub**.

### 🌟 Practical Experience & Mentorship

- **Internship-Style Learning:** Engaging in a valuable, portfolio-building learning journey with my mentor, **Noa**.
- **Real-World Application:** This process involves tackling real-world data challenges, submitting projects for rigorous feedback, and continuously iterating to meet professional standards. This approach is instrumental in building both a strong portfolio and applied confidence.

### 🎯 Immediate Goals

- My current objectives are centered on organizing my GitHub into a world-class professional portfolio, completing meaningful beginner-to-intermediate projects, and preparing actively for entry-level Data Science roles.
